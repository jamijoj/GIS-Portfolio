<summary>## Background</summary> 
<br>
The British Museum has long been a source of controversy. It is an encyclopedic museum whose mission is “to hold for the benefit and education of humanity a collection representative of world cultures ('the collection'), and ensure that the collection is housed in safety, conserved, curated, researched and exhibited” (britishmuseum.org). However, many of the objects in the collection are either suspected or confirmed to have been looted from countries that imperial Britain colonized. Well known examples are the Parthenon Marbles, the Rosetta Stone, and the Benin Bronzes, though there are many other objects in the museum’s eight million object collection that are of dubious provenance. The purpose of this project was to create a tool to act as a visual aid  to shed light on the nature of the museum’s collection. The tool includes interactive elements and quantified visuals that communicate the magnitude of the issue to the public. Additionally, with more information on looted objects, these deliverables can be developed further to build a predictive model to assess any object at the British Museum for likelihood that it was looted. Finally, this may be used as a model on how to approach decolonizing other museum collections.
