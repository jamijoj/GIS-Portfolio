# Project: Lack of Transit Access as a Factor to Arts & Culture Low Attendance Rates of Black/African American and Low-Income Communities in Pittsburgh

## Problem Statement 

In their [2020 “Culture Counts” Report](http://www.pittsburghartscouncil.org/storage/documents/Research/Culture_Counts-2020-Technical_Report.pdf), the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council (GPAC) found that attendance rates to arts and culture institutes in Pittsburgh have increased, though participation among Black and African Americans has remained poor. According to the report, “[d]espite high participation and ratings overall, the region’s arts and culture sector ranks somewhat lower among Black and African American populations on two key measures: 1) attendance and 2) ratings of the region’s arts and cultural opportunities.”  In addition, the [Pittsburgh Regional Quality of Life Survey](https://www.ucsur.pitt.edu/files/center/qol/2018/Pittsburgh%20Regional%20QOL%20Survey%20Full%20Report_2018.pdf), compiled in 2018 by the University of Pittsburgh Center for Social and Urban Research, reported that “46 percent of residents with incomes under $25,000 visit a museum, gallery or attend an arts of cultural event only two or fewer times a year compared to 21 percent of those earning $100,000 or more who attend that infrequently.”  

This same report found that of those who rely on public transit, meaning they take it at least once a week, the highest percentage (38.2 percent) make under $25,000, and while almost a quarter (23.5 percent) make between $25k and $49.9k.  It also found that “...37 percent of African American residents ride public transit at least 5 days a week, which is more than twice the rate of white residents.  In these same income brackets, almost half (45.1 percent) of those making under 25k, and 42.3 percent of those making 25k to 49.9k, rated public transit as having a “moderate” to “severe” problem.   So, though the data show that attendance rates have increased, the question remains: Who is coming? And, more importantly, who is not coming, and why not? This project will attempt to partially answer that question by revealing potential correlations between arts & culture attendance, public transit, income, and race in Pittsburgh .

Additionally, Pittsburgh is attempting to become a cultural epicenter. Culture Counts reported that “the arts and culture sector draws larger audiences than Pittsburgh’s three professional sports teams.”  A transit system that does not allow equal access to all audiences could represent lost revenue for the arts & culture sector, which has proven to be a driver of Pittsburgh’s economic health. Findings from this project can help city planners decide which transit routes need to be augmented in order to help shrink disparities in arts & culture attendance and, in turn, provide an extra boost to Pittsburgh’s income from the arts & culture sector.
