# Welcome to my GIS portfolio!

My name is Jamila Jordan and I completed a Master of Arts Management, Data Analytics track, at Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy in Pittsburgh, PA. My interests include incorporation of authentic non-Western and Indigenous narratives into the Western museum world, the integration of art and tech, and data analysis.

As an artstic person who is also interested in data analytics and data visualization, I enjoyed the possibilities offered by GIS and wanted to explore the field more. As I dove deeper into the world of GIS, I realized that the possibilities for using GIS in my fields of interest - specifically data analysis for the arts - were plenty, but that no one has really been using this tool toward that end. I decided to continue learning GIS so that I can help build up the field of data in the arts using GIS. Skills I learned and applied in practicing GIS include statistical analysis, spatial analysis, cartographic design using GIS, and methods for sharing findings from GIS like embedding responsive maps in webpages and creating dashboards that incorporate maps.
