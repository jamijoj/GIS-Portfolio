# GIS portfolio
Welcome to my GIS portfolio!

# About Me
I started learning GIS at Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. As an artstic person who is also interested in data analytics and data visualization, I enjoyed the possibilities offered by GIS and wanted to explore the field more. I am currently in an advanced GIS course to continue learning statistical analysis, spatial analysis, and cartographic design using GIS.

# Portfolio
Fell free to look through these various projects I've done using GIS.
