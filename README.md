## About me

I completed a Master of Arts Management, Data Analytics track, at Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy in Pittsburgh, PA. My interests include the integration of art and tech, and data analysis.

Check out some of my work below to see how I've explored the application of digital techniques and data analysis to various opportunities related to access.
